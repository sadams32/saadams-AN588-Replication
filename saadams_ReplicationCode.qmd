## In Search of an Honest Butterfly

![](img/cabbage.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# INTRODUCTION ---

## Study Description

In the paper "In Search of an Honest Butterfly: Sexually Selected Wing Coloration and Reproductive Traits From Wild Populations of the Cabbage White Butterfly (2021), the authors Anne E. Espeset and Matthew L. Forister describe their investigation of **Pieris rapae** (cabbage white butterfly). Specifically, these researchers tied to determine whether wing coloration functions as an honest signal of male reproductive quality, as indicated by testes size. Butterfly data was collected from four field sites (two in California (Davis and Sutter) and two in Nevada (UNR/Reno and Washoe)) which varied in agricultural use. The following data were collected from male specimens, organized by site: colorimetric variables: R50 (associated with brightness; average % reflectance between 300–375 and 450–550 nm), LR50 (associated with hue; associated wavelength to R50), and BR50 (associated with saturation; the slope of the line tangent to the point at R50); Testes Weight (mg), and Wing Length (cm). Data collected from female butterflies, also organized by site, included only the spermatophore count.

The authors outlined three hypotheses that guided their study:

(1) Does wing coloration predict tests size? Since larger testes indicate a higher likelihood to produce offspring in this species, this is an important reproductive trait.

(2) Do wing coloration and reproductive traits vary across populations with different environmental conditions (whether a site is more natural or agricultural)?

(3) Does spermatophore count (as a proxy for mating frequency) differ between study sites?

The authors included the following analyses:

-   Linear models predicting testes weight (mg) based on colorimetric variables (R50, LR50, and BR50), wing length (cm), and site (ANCOVA)

-   Site comparisons for testes weight and color variables

-   Tukey's HSD for post hoc tests for testes weight, colorimetrics, spermatophore count, and slope (testes weight by color) by site

## Replication Plan

(1) Load and clean male (Espeset2021_AnEntSoc_1) and female (Espeset2021_AnEntSoc_2) datasets.

(2) Summarize male and female data variables with means and standard deviations. These summaries are not explicitly written in the paper, but I was told by Dr. Schmitt to work under the assumption that these had been performed.

(3) Replicate Table 1, which summarizes the analysis of colorimetric variables as significant predictors for testes weight with linear models that include wing length as a covariate and site as a categorical predictor. I will perform an ANCOVA and calculate F-statistics and P-values for each colorimetric model. The authors write that the colorimetric variables (R50, LR50, and BR50) were highly correlated so three linear models were run.

(4) Replicate Figure 3a, which summarizes within and among population variation (by site) in testes weight. Tukey HSD tests will be run to determine if there are differences between populations.

## Notes

As in many papers, the step-by-step statistical methods are not outline transparently. For example, the authors explain that they checked the linear models for normality and examined variance inflation factors to determine the independence of predictors. My analysis will check these assumptions as well as others to hopefully replicate a process that way not explicitly written.

Another aspect of this paper that is worth noting is the discrepancy in reporting subject counts. For example, the authors write in the body of the text that they caught and process 367 individuals from the fours sites, but then go on to break down the counts per male and female per site which add up to 371 individuals. Further adding to the confusion, the datasets provided only contain data for 364 butterflies. The authors may have excluded individuals and not reported it. This replication analysis will move forward with the data and counts in the datasets.

## Load and Clean Data

In summary, midpoint (R50, associated with brightness) was the average percent reflectance between 300–375 and 450–550 nm; LR50, associated with hue, was calculated as the associated wavelength to R50; and BR50, associated with saturation, was calculated by finding the slope of the line tangent to the point at R50.

# INFERENTIAL STATISTICAL TEST I ---

#### Table 1 - ANCOVA

To replicate Table 1 we'll analyze colorimetric variables as significant predictors for testes weight with linear models that include wing length as a covariate and site as a categorical predictor. We're going to conduct an ANCOVA and calculate F-statistics and P-values for each colorimetric model (R50, LR50, and BR50).

## Defining the Models

**note: experimenters appear to Type I regression, even though Type II could have been used. When I tried to use Type II (the type of regression was not specified by the authors) the results were not replicated from the text. When Type I is used, the results (see Table 1) are replicated exactly.**

```{r}
R50_model <- lm(Testes_Weight_mg ~ R50 + Wing_Length_cm + Site, data = d_male) #Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3

LR50_model <- lm(Testes_Weight_mg ~ LR50 + Wing_Length_cm + Site, data = d_male) #Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3

BR50_model <- lm(Testes_Weight_mg ~ BR50 + Wing_Length_cm + Site, data = d_male) #Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3
```

## ANCOVA Assumption Checks

The authors state that for all models they checked the distribution of residuals for normality as well as the variance inflation factors "to ensure the independence of predictors." We will do the same check here, as well as others (ex. homoscedasticity) for completeness.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### R50_model

#### Preview the model

```{r}
coef(R50_model)
summary(R50_model)
```

#### Check 1: Samples are independent

There is no overlap between the samples because they were collected from different, isolated geographic sites. There is no reason to believe that the samples overlap.

#### Check 2: Homoscedasticity

```{r}
plot(fitted(R50_model), residuals(R50_model)) # module 15
abline(0,0)
```

```{r}
plot(R50_model, which = 1)
```

```{r}
plot(R50_model, 3) # scale-location (also in book of R but went to different sources for code)
```

The first two plots (very similar) show that the residuals are scattered around 0 fairly randomly and that their spread around 0 appears pretty constant, indicating homoscedasticity. The horizontal line in the scale-location plot with equally and randomly spread out points also validates the assumption of homoscedasticity.

#### Check 3: Linearity between co-variate and dependent variable

We will use component-plus-residual plot analysis to confirm the linearity assumption is satisfied.

```{r}
crPlots(R50_model) # Book of R p. 233 
```

The first two plots for R50 and Wing_length_cm follow the linear trend well.

note: The boxplots for Site can be used to assess homoscedasticity in addition to the tests we saw above. The plots are centered around 0 and have a relatively similar variance (though Washoe's variance appears larger, but the authors moved forward with their analysis so we will accept this), indicating homoscedasticity.

#### Check 4: Normality

```{r}
hist(R50_model$residuals)
```

```{r}
qqnorm(R50_model$residuals)
```

The histogram of the residuals follows a normal distribution. The points in the Q-Q plot appear to fall mostly on a linear trend line, which also indicates normality (though there is is some trail-off at the ends, but we will accept that and move forward since the authors did).

```{r}
shapiro.test(R50_model$residuals)
```

The results of this test are non-significant (p \> 0.05) so there is not evidence that this is a non-normal distribution.

#### Check 5: Variance inflation factors (performed by authors)

variance inflation factors were evaluated to ensure the independence of predictors

```{r}
vif(R50_model)
vif(R50_model) > 10
```

None of the variance inflation factors are greater than 10, so the variables are independent (the variables are not indicated to have a problem with multicollinearity (R in Action p .235))

## ANCOVA

## Table 1

### Table prep

```{r}
R50_anova_t1 <- R50_anova[rownames(R50_anova) != "Residuals",]
LR50_anova_t1 <- LR50_anova[rownames(LR50_anova) != "Residuals",]

# Combine into one table

### Define F-stat function

```{r}
# Fstat calc
f_stat_sum <- function(anova) {
  MS_factors <- anova$`Mean Sq`[1:(nrow(anova)-1)]  # mean squares for factors
  MS_residuals <- anova$`Mean Sq`[nrow(anova)]  # mean square for residuals
  
  SS_factors <- MS_factors * anova$Df[1:(nrow(anova)-1)]  # sum of squares (SS) = MS * Df for factors
  SS_residuals <- MS_residuals * anova$Df[nrow(anova)]  # sum of squares (SS) for residuals
  
  SST <- sum(SS_factors) + SS_residuals

    F_statistic = round(F_statistic, 2),
    p_value = p_format_overall)

### F-Stat calculation

```{r}

sum_R50 <- f_stat_sum(R50_anova)

sum_LR50 <- f_stat_sum(LR50_anova)

sum_BR50 <- f_stat_sum(BR50_anova)

### Format the final Table 1 to hold these results

```{r}
# add a summary row for each model, degrees of freedom = 5,179 (R/L/BR50: 1 DF, Wing Length: 1 DF, Sites: 4-1 = 3 DF --> 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 DF (lower) & 185 (total individuals) - 1 - (1 + 1 + 3) = 179 DF (upper))
table_sum <- data.frame(
  row.names = c(""),
  F_R50 = paste0("F(5,179)", " = " , sum_R50$F_statistic, "; ", "R-squared = ", sum_R50$R_squared, "; ", "P ", sum_R50$p_value),
  P_R50 = "",
  F_LR50 = paste0("F(5,179)", " = " ,sum_LR50$F_statistic, "; ", "R-squared = ", sum_LR50$R_squared, "; ", "P ", sum_LR50$p_value),
  P_LR50 = "",
  F_BR50 = paste0("F(5,179)", " = " , sum_BR50$F_statistic, "; ", "R-squared = ", sum_BR50$R_squared, "; ", "P ", sum_BR50$p_value),
  P_BR50 = ""
  )

colnames(table_sum) <- c("F-value(Df)", "P-value","F-value(Df)", "P-value", "F-value(Df)", "P-value") # column names (for the three headers)

table1_rep <- rbind(table1_rep, table_sum) # bind summary row to rest of table

table1_rep # print table so far
```

Let's format the table to look a little nicer...

```{r}
Table1 <- kbl(table1_rep) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Testes by R50 Model" = 2, "Testes by LR50 Model" = 2, "Testes by BR50 Model" = 2)) # add blank header to match paper table (top left) + rest of header names
```

## Original Table 1

![](img/Table1_original.png)

## Replicated Table 1

```{r}
Table1
```

**note #1: it is very complicated to add subscripts to the table, so I put the degrees of freedom in parentheses**

**note #2: this is not the figure I primarily focused on replicating so the formatting won't be a perfect match**

The results of the original and replicated analyses are the same! Both versions show that including site and wing length improved the explanatory power of all the models than had just the color variables alone been included.

# INFERENTIAL STATISTICAL TEST II ---

#### Figure 3a - post hoc comparisons with Tukey's HSD test

We're going to Figure 3a to summarize within and among population variation (among the 4 sites) in testes weight (mg). First we'll run an ANOVA and then perform post hoc Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) tests to determine if there are differences between the sites.

## Import data again

Only Site and Testes Weight columns will be included

```{r}
f_male <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadams32/saadams-AN588-Replication/refs/heads/main/Espeset2021_AnEntSoc_1.csv") # male butterfly data (R50, LR50, BR50, testes weight (mg))
d_male_3a <- read.csv(f_male, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE) # read in data

d_male_3a <- d_male_3a %>%
  select(Site, TestesWeight) # excludes R50, LR50, BR50, and Wing Length columns
  
colnames(d_male_3a) <- c("Site", "Testes_Weight_mg") # rename column names


d_male_3a <- d_male_3a %>%
  mutate(Site = as.character(Site), 
         Site = ifelse(Site == "UNR", "Reno", Site)) %>%
  mutate(Site = as.factor(Site)) # rename UNR to Reno (so replicated figure matches paper's figure)

d_male_3a$Site <- as.factor(d_male_3a$Site) # make sure vector converted to factor

d_male_3a <- na.omit(d_male_3a) # omit "NA" entries

head(d_male_3a) # preview
```

## Defining the Model

```{r}
model_3a <- lm(Testes_Weight_mg ~ Site, data = d_male_3a) # testes weight related to site
```

## ANOVA Assumption Check

The authors state that for all models they checked the distribution of residuals for normality as well as the variance inflation factors "to ensure the independence of predictors." We will do the same check here, as well as others (ex. homoscedasticity) for completeness.

### Preview the model

```{r}
coef(model_3a) # coefficients
summary(model_3a) # summary
```

### Check 1: Samples are independent

There is no overlap between the samples because they were collected from different, isolated geographic sites. There is no reason to believe that the samples overlap.

### Check 2: Homoscedasticity

```{r}
sds_3a <- summarize(group_by(d_male_3a, Site), sd(Testes_Weight_mg)) # calculate standard deviations of testes weight goruped by site

max(sds_3a$`sd(Testes_Weight_mg)`)/min(sds_3a$`sd(Testes_Weight_mg)`) # ratio of max/min
```

The variances appear to be relatively equal because the ratio of max/min is less than 2. This indicates that the assumption of homoscedasticity is met.

### Check 3: Normality

```{r}
hist(model_3a$residuals) # histogram of residuals
```

```{r}
qqnorm(model_3a$residuals) # Q-Q plot of residuals
```

The histogram of the residuals follows a pretty normal distribution. The points in the Q-Q plot appear to fall mostly on a linear trend line, which also indicates normality (though there is is some trail-off at the ends, but we will accept that and move forward since the authors did).

```{r}
s <- shapiro.test(model_3a$residuals) # Shapiro Test for residuals
s
```

The results of this test are non-significant (p \> 0.05) so there is not evidence that this is a non-normal distribution.

## ANOVA and Tukey's HSD

```{r}
# ANOVA
anova_3a <- aov(Testes_Weight_mg ~ Site, data = d_male_3a) # testes weight as function of explanatory variable (site)

# Tukey pair-wise comparisons 
tukey_3a <- TukeyHSD(anova_3a, "Site", conf.level = 0.95) # 
print(tukey_3a) # preview significance results (will assign letters manually)
```

Based on these results, Sutter and Davis are the only sites that are not statistically different (p \> 0.05) and so will be assigned the same letter in Figure 3a.

## Plot Prep

```{r}
# Based on Tukey results (above), manually assign letter comparisons
letter_manual <- c("Davis" = "a", "Sutter" = "a", "Washoe" = "b", "Reno" = "c") 

# Make table with information that will be used for creating plot (including order changes of sites to match figure in paper)
table_3a <- d_male_3a %>%

## Original Figure 3A

![](img/Figure_3a_original.png)

## Replicated Figure 3a

![](img/Figure_3a_rep.png) The replicated and original figures both show the same results: testes weight in the sites Davis and Sutter was the smallest and not statistically different between the sites, testes weight was then significantly larger in Reno, and testes weight was the largest in Washoe (statistically significant).
